## Getting Started

```bash
tbd
```

## Templates

The builder bundle is designed to be as unopinionated and unstyled as possible. Developers should feel empowered to build any designs they can imagine.
However, there are a few templates to serve as inspiration, or to be completely forked and deployed. Check out the examples folder for more.
