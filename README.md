Unopinionated, unstyled, UI components for the Nouns Builder ecosystem.

---

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install builder-bundle
```

## Examples

Check out the `/examples` for some examples of builder bundle in action.

## Developer Note

Due to ESM/CJS differences, builder-bundle does not currently work within next.js based packages. This is something that will be resolved with high priority.

## Templates

`coming soon`
The builder bundle is designed to be as unopinionated and unstyled as possible. Developers should feel empowered to build any designs they can imagine.
However, there are a few templates to serve as inspiration, or to be completely forked and deployed. Check out the examples folder for more.
